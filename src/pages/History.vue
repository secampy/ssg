    <h1>History of Toronto</h1>
    <p>The history of Toronto dates back thousands of years, with Indigenous peoples inhabiting the area long before European settlers arrived. 
       The city was officially founded in 1793 as the Town of York by Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe, and it was renamed Toronto in 1834.</p>
    <p>Toronto played a key role in the War of 1812, and it grew rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries, driven by waves of immigration 
       and industrial development. Today, Toronto is a multicultural metropolis, with a history shaped by the contributions of its diverse population.</p>
